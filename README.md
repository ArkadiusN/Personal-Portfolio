## About Personal Portfolio 
A portfolio is a fully responsive website that serves as an online business card. The idea for this project was inspired by the Web Development module and my personal interest in familiarizing myself with common web technologies. As a result, it became an opportunity for me to apply the knowledge acquired from my studies and the new books I read during my spare time being:

1. "Responsive Web Design with HTML5 AND CSS (Third Edition)" by Ben Frain.
2. "JavaScript & JQuery interactive front-end web development" by Jon Duckett.

Additionally, I have also utilized various online resources such as W3Schools and the Web Dev Simplified YouTube channel. These resources have allowed me to expand my knowledge beyond the books, which often target older versions of technologies. Instead, I focused on the latest versions, specifically version five of both HTML and CSS, and familiarized myself with their new features.
